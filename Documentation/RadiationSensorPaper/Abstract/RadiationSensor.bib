@article{Friedberg2000,
abstract = {Air carrier crews are occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation, principally from galactic cosmic radiation. To promote radiation safety in aviation the Federal Aviation Administration has: issued educational material on the nature of the radiation received during air travel; recommended radiation exposure limits for pregnant and nonpregnant aircrew members; developed computer programs that estimate for a given flight profile the amount of galactic radiation received on a current flight or on one flown at any time back to January 1958; published tables that enable aircrew members to estimate possible health risks associated with their occupational exposure to radiation; and conducted research on effects of radiation during pregnancy. References for this material are given in the article. In addition, graphic and tabular data in the article show how galactic radiation levels and the composition of the galactic radiation has changed between 1958 and 1999. Also given are estimates of effective doses received by air travelers on a wide variety of air carrier flights.},

@misc{Mewaldt1996,
abstract = {Cosmic rays are high energy charged particles, originating in outer space, that travel at nearly the speed of light and strike the Earth from all directions. Most cosmic rays are the nuclei of atoms, ranging from the lightest to the heaviest elements in the periodic table. Cosmic rays also include high energy electrons, positrons, and other subatomic particles. The term "cosmic rays" usually refers to galactic cosmic rays, which originate in sources outside the solar system, distributed throughout our Milky Way galaxy. However, this term has also come to include other classes of energetic particles in space, including nuclei and electrons accelerated in association with energetic events on the Sun (called solar energetic particles), and particles accelerated in interplanetary space.},
