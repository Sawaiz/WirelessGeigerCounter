# Networked Radiation Sensor

In hardware you should find 3d models, pcb's and the like Software is a a mess, there is C, Arduino, and most things are
built in Visual Studio and Atmel Studio. In documentation their are tex files, and ppt. and who knows what else.

Ok, this is getting complex enough to require a readme, currently this are vaguely organized, but there are a lot of old files used to keep a pretty poorly kept version history. Those would be deleted soon but they are somewhere in older versions...maybe branches.
